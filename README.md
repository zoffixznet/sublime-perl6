# Some ST2 snippet to edit Perl 6

Slightly adapted from the ST2 Perl package so need a lot of work.
The snippets are now mostly geared to do a presentation about operator precedence
grammar.git
Perl6.tmlanguage is hardly correct.
I want at least the C<=begin foo  =end foo> section not to trigger comment mode
until the end.

## Installation

Simply copy Perl6 directory into your `*data_path*/Packages` directory, e.g.:

    ~/.config/sublime-text-2/Packages
